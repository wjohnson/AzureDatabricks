# AzureDatabricks
A collection of resources, projects, and snippets for use in Azure Databricks

## Projects

* **CLIHelper**: Integrate the Databricks CLI with your git repo and quickly move notebook files up and down from your workspace and local git repo.
* **dbrlint**: Validate your job.json files with your own set of rules.  Provides an output of what needs to be fixed as well.
* **EventGridTriggersNotebook**: Run Databricks notebooks as soon as a file drops without the need for Azure Data Factory.  Relies on Azure Event Grid and Azure Functions instead.
